ULT is the abbreviation of the Ultiledger project's native Token. To some extent, ULT can be regarded as the “gold” of the digital domain, serving as the pricing unit for everything within the ecosystem (including various Tokens); all economic activities will be settled using ULT; the establishment and maintenance of all relationships will also depend on ULT. As the the foundation of Ultiledger’s economic ecosystem, ULT will have all the functions of money for social and economic activities - a unit of account, a medium of exchange, a standard of deferred payment, and a store of value.
